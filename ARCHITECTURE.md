# System Architecture

## Overview

This distributed synchronization system implements a fault-tolerant consensus-based architecture using the Raft algorithm. The system provides distributed primitives like locks, queues, and caches across multiple nodes.

## Core Components

### 1. Consensus Layer (Raft)
- **Location**: `src/consensus/raft.py`
- **Purpose**: Provides distributed consensus and leader election
- **Key Features**:
  - Leader election with randomized timeouts
  - Log replication across nodes
  - Fault tolerance and automatic recovery
  - Strong consistency guarantees

### 2. Node Components
Located in `src/nodes/`:

#### Base Node (`base_node.py`)
- Core networking and message passing
- Failure detection
- Component lifecycle management

#### Lock Manager (`lock_manager.py`) 
- Distributed mutex and shared locks
- Deadlock prevention
- Lock queue management

#### Queue Node (`queue_node.py`)
- Distributed FIFO queue implementation
- At-least-once delivery guarantees
- Message persistence

#### Cache Node (`cache_node.py`)
- Distributed cache with consistency
- MESI cache coherence protocol
- Automatic invalidation

### 3. Message Passing (`src/message/`)
- Asynchronous communication layer
- Protocol buffers message format
- Reliable delivery with retries
- Network partition handling

### 4. API Layer (`src/api/`)
- HTTP REST API
- WebSocket real-time updates
- Health check endpoints
- Metrics and monitoring

## Protocol Flows

### 1. Leader Election
```
Follower → Candidate → Leader
   ↑            |         |
   └------------+---------┘
```
1. Timeout triggers election
2. Candidate requests votes
3. Majority elects leader
4. Leader sends heartbeats

### 2. Lock Acquisition
```
Client → Leader → Followers
   ↑       |         |
   └-------+---------┘
```
1. Client requests lock
2. Leader logs request
3. Followers acknowledge
4. Leader grants lock
5. Client notified

### 3. Cache Updates
```
Writer → Leader → Followers → Readers
   ↑       |         |          |
   └-------+--------------------┘
```
1. Write request to leader
2. Leader replicates update
3. Followers invalidate caches
4. Readers refresh data

## Consistency Model

- Strong consistency via Raft
- Linearizable operations
- Read-after-write consistency
- Total order broadcast

## Fault Tolerance

- Automatic leader election
- Log replication for durability
- Node failure detection
- Network partition handling
- Majority consensus required

## Performance Considerations

- Batched operations
- Connection pooling
- Back-pressure handling
- Efficient log compaction
- Optimized state transfer

## Security

- TLS encryption support
- ACL-based access control
- Audit logging
- Resource quotas

## Monitoring

- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Log aggregation
- Alerts and notifications
