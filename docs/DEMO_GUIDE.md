# Demo Scripts - Comprehensive Guide

**Last Updated**: October 26, 2025  
**Status**: All demos working and tested ✅

---

## Overview

This guide explains how to run and understand the three demo scripts for the Distributed Synchronization System:

1. **Distributed Lock Manager Demo** - Demonstrates exclusive/shared locks and deadlock prevention
2. **Distributed Queue System Demo** - Shows FIFO message ordering and persistence
3. **Distributed Cache Demo** - Illustrates MESI protocol and cache coherence

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Start the Cluster First

**IMPORTANT**: All demos require a running 3-node cluster. Start it first:

```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Start cluster
cd distributed-sync-system
python benchmarks/start_cluster.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
============================================================
Distributed Synchronization System - Quick Start
============================================================

[OK] Python 3.10 detected
[OK] Dependencies installed
Starting node-1 on port 5000...
Starting node-2 on port 5010...
Starting node-3 on port 5020...

[SUCCESS] Cluster started successfully!

Node URLs:
  - node-1: http://localhost:5000
  - node-2: http://localhost:5010
  - node-3: http://localhost:5020

Press Ctrl+C to stop the cluster...
```

**Wait ~5 seconds** for cluster to stabilize and elect a leader.

### 2. Run Demo Script

```powershell
# Terminal 2 - Run demo
cd distributed-sync-system
python benchmarks/demo.py
```

---

## Demo 1: Distributed Lock Manager

### Purpose
Demonstrates how distributed locks prevent concurrent access conflicts and detect deadlocks.

### How to Run

1. Start cluster (Terminal 1)
2. Run demo script (Terminal 2)
3. Select option **1** when prompted

```powershell
python benchmarks/demo.py
# Enter: 1
```

### What It Does

The demo performs these operations:

1. **Acquire Exclusive Lock**
   - Client-1 requests exclusive lock on `resource-1`
   - Lock is granted immediately
   - Result: ✅ SUCCESS

2. **Concurrent Lock Request (Blocking)**
   - Client-2 tries to acquire shared lock on same resource
   - Lock is ALREADY held exclusively by Client-1
   - Client-2 waits in queue
   - Timeout after 2 seconds
   - Result: ⏱️ TIMEOUT (Expected behavior)

3. **Release Lock**
   - Client-1 releases lock on `resource-1`
   - Any waiting clients (Client-2) can now acquire lock
   - Result: ✅ Released

4. **Display Lock Status**
   - Shows current lock holders
   - Shows waiting clients in queue
   - Shows lock type (EXCLUSIVE/SHARED)

### Expected Output

```
============================================================
DEMO: Distributed Lock Manager
============================================================

1. Acquiring exclusive lock on 'resource-1'...
   Result: SUCCESS

2. Trying to acquire shared lock on same resource (should wait)...
   Result: TIMEOUT (Expected)

3. Releasing lock from client-1...
   Lock released

4. Lock Status:
   Resource: resource-1
   Holders: []
   Waiters: []
```

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Exclusive Lock**: Only one client can hold the lock
- **Lock Queue**: Waiting clients are queued in FIFO order
- **Timeout Handling**: Locks automatically timeout to prevent deadlock
- **Deadlock Detection**: System detects circular wait conditions

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Demo hangs at "Waiting for leader election..."

**Cause**: No majority - cluster needs at least 2 of 3 nodes running

**Solution**: 
```powershell
# Check cluster is running
netstat -ano | findstr ":5000 :5010 :5020"

# If no output, restart cluster
python benchmarks/start_cluster.py
```

**Issue**: "Connection refused" errors

**Cause**: Cluster nodes not reachable

**Solution**: Restart cluster with proper firewall settings

---

## Demo 2: Distributed Queue System

### Purpose
Shows FIFO message ordering, partition-based distribution, and persistent storage.

### How to Run

1. Start cluster (Terminal 1)
2. Run demo script (Terminal 2)
3. Select option **2** when prompted

```powershell
python benchmarks/demo.py
# Enter: 2
```

### What It Does

The demo performs these operations:

1. **Enqueue Messages (5 messages)**
   - Sends 5 messages to queue: "Message 0" through "Message 4"
   - Each message stored with timestamp
   - Messages distributed across partitions using consistent hashing
   - Result: ✅ Enqueued for each message

2. **Dequeue Messages (3 messages)**
   - Consumer-1 retrieves 3 messages from queue
   - Messages returned in FIFO order
   - Each message acknowledged after processing
   - Result: Messages 0, 1, 2 dequeued

3. **Queue Statistics**
   - Total messages in queue: 2 (remaining)
   - Number of partitions: 8
   - Active consumers: 1

### Expected Output

```
============================================================
DEMO: Distributed Queue System
============================================================

1. Enqueueing messages...
   Enqueued: Message 0: Hello from distributed queue! - SUCCESS
   Enqueued: Message 1: Hello from distributed queue! - SUCCESS
   Enqueued: Message 2: Hello from distributed queue! - SUCCESS
   Enqueued: Message 3: Hello from distributed queue! - SUCCESS
   Enqueued: Message 4: Hello from distributed queue! - SUCCESS

2. Dequeueing messages...
   Dequeued: Message 0: Hello from distributed queue!
   Dequeued: Message 1: Hello from distributed queue!
   Dequeued: Message 2: Hello from distributed queue!

3. Queue Statistics:
   Total messages: 2
   Partitions: 8
   Consumers: 1
```

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **FIFO Ordering**: Messages processed in order received
- **Consistent Hashing**: Messages distributed evenly across partitions
- **Acknowledgment**: Messages must be ACKed to prevent redelivery
- **Persistence**: Queue state persisted to disk via Raft log
- **Consumer Groups**: Multiple consumers can process messages concurrently

### Message Flow

```
[Enqueue] → [Partition Selection via Hash] → [Raft Replication] 
          → [Storage in Partition] → [Dequeue by Consumer] 
          → [Acknowledgment] → [Message Removed]
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Messages not appearing in order

**Cause**: Multiple partitions with different consumer threads

**Solution**: This is expected for distributed queue - use single partition for strict ordering

**Issue**: Messages lost after dequeue

**Cause**: Forgot to acknowledge message

**Solution**: Always call `acknowledge(message_id)` after processing

## Demo 3: Distributed Cache (MESI Protocol)

### Purpose
Demonstrates cache coherence using MESI protocol across distributed nodes.

### How to Run

1. Start cluster (Terminal 1)
2. Run demo script (Terminal 2)
3. Select option **3** when prompted

```powershell
python benchmarks/demo.py
# Enter: 3
```

### What It Does

The demo performs these operations:

1. **PUT Operations (5 entries)**
   - Stores 5 key-value pairs: `key-0` through `key-4`
   - Each value includes timestamp for tracking
   - Cache entries broadcast to other nodes
   - MESI state: MODIFIED
   - Result: ✅ SUCCESS for each PUT

2. **GET Operations (5 reads)**
   - Retrieves previously stored values
   - Hit rate should be ~100% (all keys recently added)
   - MESI state transitions: MODIFIED → EXCLUSIVE → SHARED
   - Result: Values returned successfully

3. **Cache Statistics**
   - Total cache lines: 5
   - Hit rate: 100%
   - Cache utilization: Shows % of max capacity used
   - MESI state distribution:
     - Modified: Locally modified, not yet propagated
     - Exclusive: Only this node has copy
     - Shared: Multiple nodes have copy
     - Invalid: Entry stale, needs refresh

### Expected Output

```
============================================================
DEMO: Distributed Cache (MESI Protocol)
============================================================

1. Putting values in cache...
   Put: key-0 = value-0-1698345844.123... - SUCCESS
   Put: key-1 = value-1-1698345844.623... - SUCCESS
   Put: key-2 = value-2-1698345845.123... - SUCCESS
   Put: key-3 = value-3-1698345845.623... - SUCCESS
   Put: key-4 = value-4-1698345846.123... - SUCCESS

2. Getting values from cache...
   Get: key-0 = value-0-1698345844.123...
   Get: key-1 = value-1-1698345844.623...
   Get: key-2 = value-2-1698345845.123...
   Get: key-3 = value-3-1698345845.623...
   Get: key-4 = value-4-1698345846.123...

3. Cache Statistics:
   Total lines: 5
   Hit rate: 100.00%
   Utilization: 0.50%
   States: {'modified': 0, 'exclusive': 3, 'shared': 2, 'invalid': 0}
```

### MESI State Transitions

```
[Modified] - Cache has modified data, main memory stale
    ↓ (Read by another node)
[Shared] - Multiple caches have copy, all consistent
    ↓ (Write by any node)
[Invalid] - Entry stale, must fetch from owner

[Exclusive] - Only this cache has copy, consistent with memory
    ↓ (Local write)
[Modified] - Cache modified data
```

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Cache Coherence**: All nodes see consistent view of data
- **MESI Protocol**: Tracks cache line states across nodes
- **Invalidation**: Stale entries marked invalid on remote writes
- **LRU Eviction**: Least recently used entries evicted when full
- **Broadcast Messages**: State changes broadcast to all nodes

### Cache Hit/Miss Scenarios

**Cache Hit** (fast):
1. Client requests key
2. Key found in local cache
3. MESI state valid (E, S, or M)
4. Return value immediately

**Cache Miss** (slow):
1. Client requests key
2. Key not in local cache OR state Invalid
3. Broadcast request to other nodes
4. Owner node responds with value
5. Store in local cache with appropriate MESI state
6. Return value to client

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Low hit rate (<50%)

**Cause**: Cache size too small OR keys not frequently reused

**Solution**: Increase cache size or use better caching strategy

**Issue**: Stale data returned

**Cause**: Invalidation broadcast failed

**Solution**: Check network connectivity between nodes

---

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

**Problem**: "OSError: [Errno 10048] Address already in use"

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Kill stuck Python processes
Get-Process python | Stop-Process -Force

# Wait 2 seconds
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2

# Restart cluster
python benchmarks/start_cluster.py
```

**Problem**: Demo hangs forever at "Waiting for leader election..."

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Check if cluster is running
netstat -ano | findstr ":5000 :5010 :5020"

# If no output, cluster not running - start it:
python benchmarks/start_cluster.py
```

**Problem**: "Connection refused" errors

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Check firewall allows Python connections
# Or use 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost in config

# Verify cluster nodes can reach each other:
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 5000
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 5010
Test-NetConnection -ComputerName localhost -Port 5020
```

### Demo-Specific Issues

**Lock Manager Demo**:
- If locks never timeout, check timeout parameter (default 5s)
- If deadlock not detected, verify circular wait scenario

**Queue Demo**:
- If messages out of order, check partition count
- If messages lost, verify acknowledgment is called

**Cache Demo**:
- If hit rate is 0%, check cache size configuration
- If MESI states always Invalid, check broadcast working

---

## Performance Notes

### Expected Timing

- **Lock acquire**: ~10-50ms (with leader)
- **Queue enqueue**: ~20-100ms (replication)
- **Cache PUT**: ~15-80ms (broadcast)
- **Cache GET (hit)**: ~1-5ms (local)
- **Cache GET (miss)**: ~30-150ms (remote fetch)

### Scaling Characteristics

- **Locks**: Linear degradation with lock contention
- **Queue**: Near-constant throughput per partition
- **Cache**: Hit rate improves with working set size

## Next Steps

After understanding demos:

1. **Run Benchmarks**: `python benchmarks/benchmark_runner.py`
2. **Deploy with Docker**: `docker-compose up -d`
3. **Run Integration Tests**: `pytest tests/integration/`
4. **Check Monitoring**: View metrics in logs

## Summary

| Demo | Purpose | Key Feature | Expected Result |
|------|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Lock Manager | Mutual exclusion | Deadlock detection | Timeout on conflict |
| Queue System | Message ordering | Persistent FIFO | All messages processed |
| Cache (MESI) | Data coherence | Invalidation protocol | 100% hit rate |

**All demos require running cluster** - always start `start_cluster.py` first!

For production deployment, use Docker Compose instead of demo scripts.
